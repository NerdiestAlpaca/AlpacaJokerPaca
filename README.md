## Alpaca Jokerpaca
A mod for Balatro!

## Installation

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and a version of [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded).

Once you've installed both dependencies, download the latest release zip file from the **Releases** tab and put the folder inside it in your Balatro Mods folder (`%APPDATA%/Balatro/Mods`). That's all you need to do!
